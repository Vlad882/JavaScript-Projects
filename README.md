## TicTacToe Game 
Simple well known classic game. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

## Pizza Menu
This is menu for some Pizza take away web site. Menu is used to order pizza from different size and a various toppings selection. It calculates a price of the order depending from size and topping choice.

## Calculator
Web version of a basic 4 function calculator.
